Whatsapp Onsite Interview:
===================
Went through 4 rounds of interviews with whiteboarding questions and some live coding exercises

##### Interview 1: 
  Sum two "linked lists" together (reversed, and then summed them, and then reversed again - keep track of carries)
  JavaScript closure questions


##### Interview 2: 
  Deep copy a tree with A and B nodes
  Follow up: complexity, what happens if there's a cycle in the "tree"

##### Interview 3:
  Implement a Scramble with Friends solver (recursively)
  How would you implement the isPrefix version - a Trie
  How would you store this trie - encode and decode it

##### Interview 4: 
  Take a sorted list and give the binary search tree representing that list back
  How would you modify a binary tree to become a complete binary search tree?
