# Signup Validation

This is a small sinatra app which contains a simple quizlet-esque app with a signup form. Currently the form doesn't do any client-side validations and needs to hit the server for everything.

## The Goal

The candidate should design and implement client-side validations on this signup form. Where necessary, the interviewer can collaborate and build-out JSON endpoints for the client-side validations to use via AJAX (ex. username checking).

## Getting started

Before starting the server, make sure the necessary gems are installed by running `bundle install`.

You can start the server by running `rerun 'ruby server.rb'`. `rerun` is a utility that will restart the server whenever you change the underlying ruby server.rb file.

Good luck!
